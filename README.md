# 💬 Real-Time Chat Application

This is a **real-time chat application** developed as **Task 1** during my internship with **CodTech**, using the **MERN Stack** (React.js + Node.js + Express.js + Socket.IO). It allows multiple users to join the platform and exchange messages instantly in a shared chat room.

 🛠️ Technologies Used

 Frontend:
- **React.js** (for UI)

 Backend:
- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Socket.IO Server**

How it Works
User enters a username to join the chat.

Messages are sent through Socket.IO from the frontend.

Backend listens and broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

Each user sees messages instantly without page refresh.

🧠 Learning Outcomes
As part of the CodTech Internship, this project helped me understand and implement:

Event-driven architecture using Socket.IO

Real-time web application development

React.js state management and conditional rendering

Backend server setup with Express and CORS

Styling using Tailwind CSS

📃 Internship Task Description
